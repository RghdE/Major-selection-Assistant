# Major-selection-Assistant
For those who have an interest in technology, the system will recommend a *computer-relatedÂ degree*. Students can get an overview of the best major for them depending on how they respond to the system's questions. The system is implemented in two paradigmatically distinct programming languages: **Prolog and Python**.

## System Flowchart Design

A flowchart was used to create a *conceptual model*. This design took into account students' abilities and preferences, their satisfaction with college courses, and their background knowledge in each major. The system operates as follows: users begin by selecting the character attribute that best fits them, which directs them to a single major. Then, respond to the *major-related questions that follow; each question has a computed weight*. The system will **offer major's jobs to users based on this calculated weight** if there are more than two valid responses for each major. The flowchart is created to depict the expert system's execution sequence in order to provide an accurate recommendation. The diagram below illustrates the flowchart in detail, including all of the rules.
